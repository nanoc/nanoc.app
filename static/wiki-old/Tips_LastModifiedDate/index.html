<h1>Putting a "last modified on/at" line on your site</h1>

Pages have a 'mtime' attribute which can be used to get the last modified date/time, like this:

<pre><code>
<p>This page was last updated at &lt;%= @item.mtime %>.</p>
</code></pre>

which could be compiled to

<pre><code>
<p>This page was last modified at Mon Oct 01 15:57:30 +0200 2007.</p>
</code></pre>

A nicely-formatted timestamp can be obtained by using the following code:

<pre><code>
&lt;%= @item.mtime.strftime("%A %B %d, %Y at %H:%M:%S %Z") %>
</code></pre>

which would yield something like:

<pre><code>
"Wednesday December 19, 2007 at 02:45:42 CST"
</code></pre>
</pre>
