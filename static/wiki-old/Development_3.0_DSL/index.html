<h1>The nanoc 3 compilation/mapping DSL</h1>

nanoc 3.0 will have a Rake-like DSL for compiling and mapping items. This DSL will make it easier to work with multiple representations and filters with arguments.

This approach has quite a few advantages:

 * <b>Much more DRY processing</b>: Items no longer need their own list of processing instructions, which eliminates a lot of duplication of processing instructions between items. In nanoc 2.x, even when a hundred items need the same processing instructions, it will need to be written a hundred times.

 * <b>Separation of metadata and processing instructions</b>: The metadata for each item contains both real metadata (<code>title</code>, <code>author</code>, ...) as well as processing instructions (<code>layout</code>, <code>filters_pre</code>, ...). This makes it hard to add new processing instructions, since these can cause namespace collisions that are hard to track down and solve.

 * <b>Cleaner multiple representations</b>: Multiple representations are purely on the processing side and there should not be a need to tell a item to build its reps.

 * <b>Cleaner filter arguments</b>: Filter arguments can simply be function arguments, because calling a filter will simply be the same as calling a function.

<h2>Elements</h2>

The DSL performs three tasks:

 1. Determine the representations for each item (using the compilation rules).
 2. Map the representations onto output paths (using the mapping rules).
 3. Compile the representations (using the compilation rules).

<h2>Compilation</h2>

<pre><code>
#!ruby
# Item is copied
compile '/style/print' do
  # do nothing (except write)
end

# Item is compiled (multiple reps)
compile '/style/screen', :rep => 'default' do
  filter :sass
end
compile '/style/screen', :rep => 'raw' do
  # do nothing (except write)
end

# Layout is filtered
layout '/default', :erb

# Item is filtered (single rep)
compile '/' do
  filter :erb
  layout 'default'
  filter :rubypants
end

# Item is filtered (single rep; conditionals)
compile '/sitemap' do
  # run the item through a PHP filter if we're in development mode (so that the
  # autocompiler acts as a web server that supports PHP) to emulate what the
  # site would look like on a real production server that supports PHP
  filter :php unless ENV['NANOC_ENV'] == 'production'
  layout 'default'
  filter :rubypants
end

# Item is filtered (multiple reps)
compile '/about', :rep => 'html' do
  layout 'default'
  filter :rubypants
end
compile '/about', :rep => 'raw' do
  # do nothing (except write)
end

# Multiple items
compile '/journal/*/*' do
  filter :erb
  layout 'article'
end
</code></pre>

To process items based on metadata, it is best to create a general rule and then conditionally process items.

<h2>Layouts</h2>

To tell a layout which filter it should use, something like this will be used:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
layout '/default/', :haml
layout '/foo/'    , :haml
layout '/bar/'    , :haml
layout '*'        , :erb
</code></pre>

<h2>Snapshots</h2>

Because this DSL allows a item to be laid out multiple times, the terms "pre-compilation content" and "post-compilation content" (<code>:pre</code> and <code>:post</code>) have lost their meaning. It may therefore be useful to add support for "snapshots" which mark certain points in the compilation process. For example:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
compile '/test' do
  snapshot :raw

  filter :first_filter
  filter :second_filter
  filter :third_filter

  snapshot :before_first_layout

  layout 'article'
  filter :another_filter

  snapshot :after_first_layout
  snapshot :before_second_layout

  filter :yet_another_filter
  filter :last_filter

  snapshot :after_second_layout
end
</code></pre>

To prevent having to explicitly define all snapshots, some predefined snapshots could be created:

 * <code>:raw</code>: uncompiled
 * <code>:pre</code>: right before the item is laid out for the last time
 * <code>:post</code>: after the item has been laid out for the last time and filtered (i.e. at the end of the compilation process)

<h2>Mapping</h2>

The <code>#write</code> method cannot have arguments such as <code>:path</code>, <code>:filename</code> and <code>:extension</code> to tell where items should be written to. This is because the output path of an item is only known after that item has been compiled; therefore, all items would have to be recompiled even when they are not outdated.

One way to solve this would mean specifying items' output path using a sort of "map", similar to routing functionality found in common Ruby web frameworks. If flexible enough, this could replace routers. There are a few different possibilities for what this could look like. nanoc3 uses a <code>route</code> function that takes an identifier, a rep name and returns the path as a string, like this:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
route '/bar/', :rep => 'xyzzy' do
  if item[:version]
    "/bar-v#{item[:version]}/index.html"
  else 
    "/bar/index.html"
  end
end
</code></pre>
</pre>
  </body>
</html>
