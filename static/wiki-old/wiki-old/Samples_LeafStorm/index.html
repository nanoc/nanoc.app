Not everything from this wiki was migrated to the new wiki because quite a bit was no longer relevant. The contents of the old wiki are nonetheless preserved here in case you need it.</div>

<a href="http://www.leafstorm.us/">leafstorm.us</a> is just a small personal Web site I put together in nanoc. You can browse the code on Bitbucket at http://www.bitbucket.org/leafstorm/leafstorm.us/. It doesn't really use any of nanoc's advanced features, especially since I blog using a Zine instance on a subdomain, but I suppose it could be a good example of how to use nanoc for simple sites.

It requires the <code>RedCloth</code> and <code>haml</code> gems to compile.</pre>
