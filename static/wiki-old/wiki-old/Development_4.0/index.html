<h1>nanoc 4.0 Brainstorming</h1>

This page is used to collect ideas for a future version of nanoc. Such features or changes will likely be backwards-incompatible with nanoc 3.x, because they would be included in 3.x otherwise.

<b>No development on nanoc 4.0 has started yet, and work on 4.0 won’t start for a long while. Consider this page more like a repository of ideas that cannot currently be implemented in 3.x due to compatibility constraints.</b>

<h2>Identifiers without trailing slash</h2>

The trailing slash of item identifier is annoying and should be removed. For example, an item at <code>content/foo/bar/qux.html</code> would become <code>/foo/bar/qux</code>, not <code>/foo/bar/qux/</code>.

This will allow patterns in compilation and routing rules to be closer to filesystem globs. For example:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
# in nanoc 3.0.x, this rule will be applied to the item /foo/ as well as its
# descendants (children, grandchildren, …). If item identifiers do not have
# a trailing slash, this rule will be applied only to descendants of /foo, and
# not to /foo itself.
compile '/foo/*' do
  # ...
end

# in nanoc 3.0.x, this rule will be applied to the descendants of /foo/. If
# item identifiers do not have a trailing slash, this rule will not be applied
# to anything (because no identifier ends with a trailing slash).
compile '/foo/*/' do
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

In order to remain backward compatible, comparison of item identifiers with strings should still work. For example, <code>@item.identifier == '/foo/bar/'</code> should still return true, even though the identifier is '/foo/bar'. Overriding <code>#==</code> is probably a bad idea, so maybe <code>#=~</code> could be used instead (would break compatibility, though). Identifiers would be represented using a <code>Identifier</code> class, which can be constructed from a <code>String</code>.

<h2>No more identifiers</h2>

Identifiers are a source of confusion and should perhaps be removed. Compilation and routing rules could be applied to file paths directly, like this:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
compile '/*.html.erb' do
  filter :erb
end

compile '/articles/*' do
  # ... compile all articles here ...
end
</code></pre>

A drawback of this approach is that, when linking to an item, you must be sure to include the extension, like this:

<pre><code>
<%= link_to "The About Page", @items.find { |i| i.identifier == '/about.html' } %>
</code></pre>

… which is pretty ugly. What if you’d want to rename <code>about.html</code> to <code>about.html.erb</code>, or <code>about.md</code>? You’d have to update all links, which is not pretty. Also: since items can still be routed, there is no clear distinction between item paths and item rep paths: <code>/about.html</code> could suddenly become <code>/about/index.html</code>, leading to more confusion that it’s worth.

There could be a method which returns a string equivalent to the nanoc3 identifier (something like File.dirname + File.basename where all semantic extensions have been removed)

<pre><code>
<%= link_to "The About Page", @items.find { |i| i.stem == '/about' } %>
</code></pre>

This would have application in routing rules too: 

<pre><code>
#!ruby
route '/stylesheets/*' do
  item.stem + '.css'
end

route '*' do
  item.stem + '/index.html'
end
</code></pre>

One step further could be using a special entity for storing identifiers, and allowing them to be matched both with and without extension. For example:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
ident = Nanoc3::Identifier.new('/software/nanoc.md')
ident =~ '/software/nanoc'        # => true
ident =~ '/software/adsf'         # => false
ident =~ '/software'              # => false
ident =~ '/software/nanoc.md'     # => true
ident =~ '/software/nanoc.wobble' # => false
ident =~ '/software/*'            # => true
ident =~ '/software/nanoc.*'      # => true
ident =~ '/software/*.md'         # => true
ident =~ '/software/*.xyz'        # => false
</code></pre>

When comparing with a regular expression, the full identifier string with extension is used.

nanoc currently drops the “index/” suffix in item identifiers, so that a file at content/about/index.html becomes /about/ instead of /about/index/. Getting rid of this special case would simplify things and clear up some confusion.

<h2>No Online Data Sources</h2>

nanoc 3.0 introduced online data sources, allowing data to be read from sources such as Twitter, Last.fm, Delicious, etc. Unfortunately, letting nanoc handle online data sources had some drawbacks:

 * <b>It slows down the compilation process.</b> A <code>nanoc3 co</code> is no longer fast; the data first has to be fetched from various sources, which takes time.

 * <b>It may even prevent the site from being compiled.</b> If the data can’t be fetched, nanoc3 will throw an error and refuse to compile the site. There is no way around this: letting nanoc compile the site regardless of data-loading errors may not work because some required data could be missing. For the same reason, uncommenting the data source in the configuration file is also not a good solution.

As far as I can see, there is only one way to solve these issues: the data-fetching stage should not be nanoc's responsibility. Instead, data should be downloaded and stored in a format recognisable by the used data source(s). <b>nanoc should still support multiple data sources</b> as this is one of nanoc’s strengths (even if it makes the configuration file a tad more confusing.

<h2>No more “filter” name</h2>

“Filters” are not the right name for the text transformation objects that nanoc uses. Transformer? Transformator? Formatter? …</pre>
