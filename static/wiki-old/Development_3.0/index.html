<h1>nanoc 3 Brainstorming</h1>

nanoc 2.x has proven to be quite good for creating small web sites of somewhat low complexity. However, while working on several nanoc-powered web sites, a handful of conceptual issues have become obvious. This page collects ideas (in the form of tickets) which could be implemented in order to improve nanoc.

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

nanoc 3.x is incompatible with nanoc 2.x due to the large amount of backward-incompatible changes. nanoc 3.x has none of the legacy that nanoc 2.x has.

There will likely not be a nanoc-2.x-to-nanoc-3.x conversion script (writing such as script would be theoretically impossible). There will be a migration guide, though.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

 <b>must</b> (requirement must be fulfilled)::
   * #30: Dependency tracking
   * #43: Compilation DSL
   * #58: Mapping/routing DSL
 <b>should</b> (requirement should be fulfilled but is not a show stopper)::
   * #63: Data preprocessing
   * #27: Filter arguments
   * #62: Multiple data sources
 <b>nice to have</b> (requirement is purely optional)::
   * #61: Fail-fast helpers
   * #64: Ad-hoc filters
 <b>future</b> (this might be a good idea for a later release but should not influence the current version)::
   * (nothing)

<h2>The compilation DSL</h2>

nanoc 3.0 will have a Rake-like DSL for compiling pages. This DSL will make it easier to work with multiple representations and filters with arguments. In addition, it should make it possible to combine objects: combine all stylesheets into one stylesheet, combine two images into a single one, combine multiple pages and images into a single PDF document, etc.

See the <a href="../Development_3.0_DSL/">main wiki page for the compilation DSL</a> for details.
