title:     "Page Not Found"
---

<p>Unfortunately, the page you requested was not found on the server. It may have have been removed; the site was recently restructured quite a bit and some outdated pages were removed in the process.</p>

<p>If you arrived on this page by entering an address (URL) manually, double-check it to make sure that you did not accidentally mistyped the address.</p>

<p>If you arrived on this page by following a link on the web site, then that link is broken. If you want, let me know on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">discussion group</a> so that I can fix it as soon as possible. Thanks a lot in advance!</p>
